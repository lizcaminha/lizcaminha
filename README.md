### Hello! Eaí? ;P
*pt-br*

Eu sou a Liz! Estudante de informática aspirando à ciência da computação. Bem-vindo(a) à minha página no Github, onde mantenho meus projetos esporadicamente e sem pretensão alguma.
Estou aqui para aprender. Sou uma desenvolvedora bem amadora, e não pretendo seguir na área de desenvolvimento. Meus repositórios vão ser sempre diversos, entre webdev, trabalhos da escola, testes rápidos... entre outros.
Obrigada pela visita.

My name is Liz! I'm an IT student and aspiring computer scientist based in Brazil 🇧🇷. In this website I keep my projects unpretentiously and sporadically. I am here to learn, as a very amateur developer. I don't intent on following software development as a career, but I am looking to learn all I can. My repositories have little in common with each other, from web development, homework, quick tests, and a bunch of other things.
Thank you for stopping by!

I try to not be stuck with one single language. And if you know anything at all about me, you know I'm a Linux user. For life! The terminal is my second home.
 

#### About visibility and collaboration
If you're stopping by my repositories: thank you! They aren't up to most standards, so if you think you can help me out/teach me something about what I'm working on, feel free to drop a PR, Issue, or discussion post. I love that. 

My heart belongs to open-source software. Most, if not all, of my work will be public. Again, feel free to interact or look around as you wish.
I invite collaborators sparingly. Don't ask me to do that.
